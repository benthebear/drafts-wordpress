This Plugin adds a Button to the Admin-Menu that lead directly to the Post Drafts,
as well a Dashboard Widget, that lists a configurable Amount of recent Drafts.

== Description ==

I found it very hand to have a quick access to all Drafts, so this Plugins first purpose is
to add a Button to the Admin-Menü. This button contains a link to the Post-Admin selecting
only the Drafts.

Also, the Wordpress' own Recent Drafts Dashboard Widget contained to few Drafts for my needs.
So this Plugin comes with a Dashboard Widget, that shows a configurable Amount of Drafts.


== Installation ==


1. Upload the Folder `more-drafts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

or … just install it via Wordpress' Plugin Repository.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use only the Dashboard and not the Admin-Menu Button? =

No, sorry, currently not.
